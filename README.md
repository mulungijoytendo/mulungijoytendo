## Hi, Iâ€™m Mulungi Joy Tendo  ðŸ‘‹

   A passionate UI/UX designer and frontend developer focused on crafting seamless, engaging experiences across web and mobile platforms.
  
  With a strong foundation in user-centered design and front-end technologies, I specialize in creating intuitive, visually compelling interfaces that not only look good but perform flawlessly. My experience spans eCommerce solutions, book applications built with Django, and various modern digital products that blend function with form.
  
  Driven by curiosity and a desire to grow, Iâ€™m constantly exploring better ways to design and build. Whether itâ€™s improving the user flow of a checkout page or developing a responsive mobile app, I bring creativity, precision, and empathy to every project.
  
  When Iâ€™m not designing or coding, I love learning from design trends, enhancing my skills through real-world projects, or collaborating with other creatives.
  
  âš¡ Fun Facts:
  ðŸŽ¨ I enjoy redesigning everyday apps just for fun.
  ðŸ“± I'm deeply inspired by minimal, user-first mobile experiences.
  ðŸ“š I love discovering new tools and techniques that elevate both design and development.
